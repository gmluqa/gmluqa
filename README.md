### Hello there... ðŸ™‚

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build great web-apps and exploring the capabilities of blockchain enhanced technology!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.

Here are some projects I've worked on:
- [Movie Rentals Back-end](https://github.com/gmluqa/movie-backend)
- [Movie Rentals Front-end](https://github.com/gmluqa/movie-frontend)
- [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/gmluqa/Noughts-and-Crosses)

My most comfortable language would probably be JavaScript, but I love learning new frameworks that involve languages that are new to me. Most recently I dived head first into PHP with Laravel, and found the developer experience to be very pleasant. 

Career-wise I'm looking to work with anything related to linux systems, Containers, and/or VM's, web-development and blockchain/financial applications.

Thank you for visiting my about me page, if you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate to send me an email at: gmluqa@protonmail.com
