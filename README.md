- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build great web-apps and exploring the capabilities of blockchain enhanced technology! (And when I can, I look into gamedev with Godot)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.

Here are some projects I've worked on (may not be up to date):
- [Movie Rentals Back-end](https://github.com/gmluqa/movie-backend)
- [Movie Rentals Front-end](https://github.com/gmluqa/movie-frontend)
- [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/gmluqa/Noughts-and-Crosses)

My most comfortable language would probably be JavaScript, but I am comfortable working adapting and learning new technologies/stacks/frameworks. This may stem from my strange fixation with reading manuals+docs (I actually really enjoy reading manuals), RTFM is my philosophy, but in a non-condescending way.

Career-wise I'm looking to work with anything related to linux systems, Containers, and/or VM's, web-development and blockchain/financial applications. 

Thank you for visiting my about me page, if you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate to add me!
